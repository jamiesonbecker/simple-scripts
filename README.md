###Changelog

*** 1.1.1 ***
* Allowing the ">" direct child selector.

***1.1***
* Removed unneeded hidden input
* Added Action Hooks
* Added cleanup on deletion
* Added author attribution option
* Added a more elegant method for adding CSS to the page:

Instead of using print_scripts to insert the CSS directly into the HEAD, CSS styles are generated within simple-custom-css.php (the sole file for this plugin), then added via wp_enqueue_scripts, so now it will appear in the HEAD as:

		<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://yoursite.com/?sccss=1" />

...even though no css file is actually generated.

***1.0***
* Inital Release
