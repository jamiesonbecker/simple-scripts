Simple Custom CSS Plugin
=================

An easy-to-use WordPress Plugin to add custom scripts (like Google Analytics) to your website's Header and/or Footer.  Great for Administrators who don't want to store their custom scripts in a theme's options.  These fields will remain even if the theme is changed.

**Features**

- No configuration needed, just enter your JavaScript(s).
- Scripts print after enqueued scripts (like jQuery) are rendered
- Simple interface built on WordPress UI
- Virtually no impact on site performance
- Uses no JavaScript files or complicated database queries
- Generates no files
- Extremely lightweight (~8KB)
- Thorough Documentation
